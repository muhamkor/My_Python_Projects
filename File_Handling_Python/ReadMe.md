## Word Counter

This is a simple Python program that counts the number of characters and words in a text file.

### Usage

To use the program, simply provide the name of the text file as a command-line argument. For example, to count the number of characters and words in the file `words.txt`, you would run the following command:

```bash
python word_counter.py words.txt
```

The program will then print the number of characters and words in the file to the console.

### Example Output

```
There are 100 characters in this file
There are 20 words in this file
```
